<h1>
<span>Workshop Question 2: File IO</span>
</h1>

<p><span>Please read <a href='ReadMe.html'> important information</a> first. </span>

</p>

<h2 ><span>Description</span></h2>

<p> We will use a sphere which has a radius <i> r </i>, for this question.

We will also use a cup and a glass.

<p><span>Read the three variables <i>r, cup_volume, glass_volume</i> from a given file name, each placed in a separate line, respectively. </span></p>

<hr>

<p>

Write three functions <i>calculate_sphere_diameter</i>, <i> calculate_sphere_area</i>, and <i>calculate_sphere_volume</i>. 

</p>

<p>
  
<code>calculate_sphere_diameter</code> must calculate the sphere's diameter as <i>2 * r></i> and return that value.

</p>

<p>
<code>calculate_sphere_area </code> must calculate <i> 4 * 3 * r<sup>2</sup> </i> and return that value, taking the PI as 3.
</p>

<p>
<code>calculate_sphere_volume</code> must evaluate the volume of the sphere by <i> 4 / 3 * 3 * r <sup>3</sup> </i>, taking the PI as 3.

</p>

<hr>

<p>

We cut the sphere in half and we have a cup which is larger than our half-sphere and we wish to fill it by using our half-sphere. Display how many times we should use the half-sphere to fill the cup fully. (The cup's volume is a multiple of the half-sphere's volume.)

</p>

<p>

Next, we have a glass which is smaller than our half-sphere and we wish to fill the half-sphere by using the glass's entire volume; however this time, the half-sphere's volume is not a multiple of the glass so the half-sphere will not be full in the end. Display as integer what percentage of the half-sphere's volume will be empty.

</p>
