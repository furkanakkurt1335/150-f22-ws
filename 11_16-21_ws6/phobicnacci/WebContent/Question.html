        You are supposed to read 3 integers from a file. Then, you are expected to write a recursive function under the definition of `phobicnacci` given to you. A phobicnacci number is similar to fibonacci number but with a slight difference. Phobicnacci numbers go crazy when the previous two numbers are divisible by 2 so they are phobic. Phobicnacci number is the sum of its previous 2 phobicnacci numbers if the previous two phobicnacci numbers are not divisible by 2. Otherwise it is the sum of the half of the first phobicnacci number and double plus 1 of the second one. First and second phobicnacci numbers are given in the first two lines of the file respectively. The `phobicnacci` function eventually returns the `n`th phobicnacci number.


          <br/>
          <br>
          All inputs in the file will be integers so notice that all phobicnacci numbers must be integers as well. Consider this while defining your function.
          <br/>

        Note: Using recursion is mandatory; other solutions are not accepted.
