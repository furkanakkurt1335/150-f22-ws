        You are supposed to read 3 integers from a file. Then, you are expected
        to write a recursive function under the definition of `phobicnacci`
        given to you. A phobicnacci number is similar to a fibonacci number but
        with a slight difference. Phobicnacci numbers go crazy when the previous
        two numbers are divisible by 2 so they are phobic. A phobicnacci number
        is the sum of its previous 2 phobicnacci numbers if the previous two
        phobicnacci numbers are not divisible by 2; otherwise, it is the sum of
        the half of the previous phobicnacci number and 2 times plus 1 of the
        second previous one. First and second phobicnacci numbers are given in
        the first two lines of the file respectively. The `phobicnacci` function
        eventually returns the `n`th phobicnacci number.

        <br />
        <br />
        All inputs in the file will be integers so notice that all phobicnacci
        numbers must be integers as well. Consider this while defining your
        function.
        <br />
        <br />

        Your function is expected to: <br />
        1) count the number of calls to itself and keep this value in
        <code>count</code> variable.<br />
        2) return the nth phobicnacci number.<br /><br />

        In the <b>last</b> editable block (DO_NOT_EDIT part), call your function
        as <code>res = phobicnacci(n)</code> and print the result as shown below.
        <br /><br />
        Note: Using recursion is mandatory; other solutions are not accepted.
