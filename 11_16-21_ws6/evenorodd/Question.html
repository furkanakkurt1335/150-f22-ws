  You are supposed to read two integers `n`(2 digit number) and 't' from a file. Then, you are expected to write a recursive function under the definition of `evenodds` given to you. The first Evenodds number (at t=1) is the reverse of 'n' if 'n' is even, 11 more if 'n' is odd. Evenodds numbers will go on until it becomes a three digit number. The 'evenodds' function must return the 't'th Evenodds number of 'n'. 
        Note: Using recursion is mandatory; other solutions are not accepted.

Question 1:
 n=12, t=5
Result:43 
Question 2: 
n=34 t=4
Result: 56
Question 3:
n=19 t=7
Result: 36
