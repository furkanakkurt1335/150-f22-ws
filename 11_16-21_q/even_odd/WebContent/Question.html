        First, get the file path with input() and do not use any prompt messages. 
        You are supposed to read two integers `n` (2 digit number) and `t` from
        a file where n specifies the number and t denotes the <i>turn</i>. 
        Then, you are expected to write a recursive function under the
        definition of `even_odd` given to you. The `even_odd` function must 
        return the `t`'th Even_odd number of `n`.
        
        The first even_odd number (at t=1) is the reverse of `n` if `n` is even, 
        11 more if `n` is odd. Even_odd numbers will go on until they become a 
        three digit number. Note: Using recursion is mandatory; other solutions are 
        not accepted.

        The following table is just for illustration purposes. You are not supposed 
        to write intermediate results on the screen.
        
        Input: n=13, t=5 
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>13</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>24</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>42</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>24</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>42</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Res:</td>
            <td>24</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
