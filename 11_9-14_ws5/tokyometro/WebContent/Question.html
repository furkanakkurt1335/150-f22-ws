        A person uses transportation to go to work or their school. This transportation system has personal cards that
        people use to pay for their trips. Students pay less money. We want to calculate how much they would pay in a
        month. This
        transportation system requires that passengers pay for how many stations they go in a single trip.

        Note: They calculate how many stations they used the transportation system before leaving by receiving the
        highest amount (750 in a student's case) on entrance and giving back if they use the system less than the
        highest amount.

        You will be given an input file. This file's content is as follows: the first line is a string of <span
          style="font-family: Courier">'Student'</span> or <span style="font-family: Courier">'Worker'</span> indicating
        the person's card, the second line is for how many days a person uses the transportation system in a month
        (integer). Please assume, this person goes to their work or school in the morning and goes back home in the
        evening.

      </p>
      <p>

        You are requested to output (print) how much money they pay in a month for all 3 cases of usage (3 stations or less, 4 to 8 stations or, 9 or more stations) in separate lines.
