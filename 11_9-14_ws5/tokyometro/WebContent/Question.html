        A person uses transportation to go to work or their school. This transportation system has personal cards that
        people use to pay for their trips. Students pay less money. The cards are capable of storing money, as well as
        providing a monthly service of 200 usages. In this monthly service, people pay a certain amount of money and
        they get 200 usages for the month. We want to calculate if they would be better off using the monthly service or
        just pay as they go, meaning they pay for each trip individually. This transportation system also allows
        secondary and tertiary (3) usages at discount prices. These discounts are for when somebody pays for the
        transportation system again in a couple hours from their last time. This is useful if somebody uses
        transportation and reaches their destination by more than 1 vehicle.

        You will be given an input file. This file's content is as follows: the first line is a string of <span
          style="font-family: Courier">'Student'</span> or
        <span style="font-family: Courier">'Worker'</span> indicating the person's card, the second line is for how many
        days a person uses the transportation
        system in a month (integer). Please assume, this person goes to their work or school in the morning and goes
        back home
        in
        the evening.
      </p>
      <p>

        You are requested to output (print) as follows for all 3 cases of usage (1 vehicle, 2 vehicles or 3 vehicles):
        If they are better off using the monthly service. Print <span style="font-family: Courier">'Monthly
          service'</span> in the first line. Then, print how
        much
        money they save by using the monthly service instead of the pay-as-you-go system.
        On the other hand, if they are better off using the pay-as-you-go system, print <span
          style="font-family: Courier">'Pay-as-you-go system'</span> in the
        first line. Then, print how much money they save by using the pay-as-you-go system instead of the monthly
        service. The last print statement of the saved amount is in <span style="font-family: Courier">'Main.py'</span> already, so you don't have to write it.
        At the end, you print for all 3 cases of usage. First for if the person uses 1 vehicle to go to their workplace or school; second for if the person uses 2 vehicles; and third for if they use 3 vehicles.
