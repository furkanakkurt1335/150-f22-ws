        A person uses transportation to go to work or their school. This transportation system has personal cards that people use to pay for their trips. Students pay less amount of money. The cards are capable of storing money, as well as providing a monthly service of 200 usages. In this monthly service, people pay a certain amount of money and they get 200 usages for that month. We want to calculate if they would be better off using the monthly service or just pay-as-they-go, meaning they pay for each individual trip. This transportation system also allows secondary and tertiary (3) usages at discount prices. These discounts are applied when somebody pays for the transportation system again in a couple hours from their last usage. This is useful if somebody uses transportation and reaches their destination by more than 1 vehicle.

        You will be given an input file. This file's content is as follows: the first line is a string of <span style="font-family: Courier">'Student'</span> or <span style="font-family: Courier">'Worker'</span> indicating the person's card, the second line is for how many days a person uses the transportation system in a month (integer). Please assume, this person goes to their work or school in the morning and goes back home in the evening.    </p>
      
      
      <p>

        You are requested to output (print) as follows for all 3 cases of usage (1 vehicle, 2 vehicles or 3 vehicles): 
        <br>
        - If they are better off using the monthly service, print <span style="font-family: Courier">'Monthly service'</span> in the first line. Then, print how much money they save by using the monthly service instead of the pay-as-you-go system.
        <br>
        - On the other hand, if they are better off using the pay-as-you-go system, print <span style="font-family: Courier">'Pay-as-you-go system'</span> in the first line. Then, print how much money they save by using the pay-as-you-go system instead of the monthly service. 
      </p>
      <p>

        The last print statement of the saved amount is in <span style="font-family: Courier">'Main.py'</span> already, so you don't have to write it. At the end the program, you will have outputs for all 3 cases of usage types, namely 1 vehicle transport, 2 successive vehicles transport, and 3 successive vehicles transport.
