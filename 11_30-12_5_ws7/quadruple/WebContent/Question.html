        <p>
          In this question, you are asked to print numbers according to the
          following:
        </p>
  
        <p>
          You need to read a file with 3 integers.
          The file starts with an integer seed value. <br>
          You need to read two additional positive integers from the file as the first number (f) and second number (s), respectively. <br>
          Check if the second one is less than the first one or any of the numbers are negative. If so, display
          <strong>INVALID INPUT</strong> and call `exit()`.<br><br> 
          
          Generate a single random integer between 15 and 50 as the repetition count. <br>
          Output the first number followed by the second number in individual lines. <br>
          
          Repeat the following as much as the repetition count:<br>
          1. If the current iteration is a multiple of 4, calculate the result as <strong> 3·f + 4·s </strong>. <br>
          2. If the current iteration is one more than a multiple of 4, calculate the result as </strong> 4·f + s^(f % 3) </strong>. <br>
          3. If the current iteration is two more than a multiple of 4, calculate the result as the remainder of <strong> 2·f + 2·s </strong> divided by 500. <br>
          4. If the current iteration is three more than a multiple of 4, calculate the result as the remainder of <strong> (f % 100) + (s % 100) </strong>. <br>
          
          Output the result in an individual line.<br>
          At the end, convert the result into an integer, for all 4 cases above.<br>
          Then, set the first number to be the current second number and set the second number to be the calculated result. <br> Continue with the next iteration. <br> <br>
  
          DO NOT write any prompt messages inside the input functions.
          Be careful with your output, such as spacing in the output or upper
          case messages.
