      <p>
        In this question, you are asked to print numbers according to the
        following:
      </p>

      <p>
        You need to read a file with 3 integers.
        The file starts with an integer seed value. <br /> You need to read two
        additional positive integers from the file as the first number (f) and
        second number (s), respectively.<br /> Check if the second one is less than
        the first one or any of the numbers are negative. If so, display
        <strong>INVALID INPUT</strong> and call `exit()`.<br /><br /> Generate a single
        random integer between 5 and 30 as the repetition count. <br />Output the
        first number followed by the second number in individual lines. <br />Repeat
        the following as much as the repetition count:<br /> 1. If the current iteration
        is a multiple of 3, calculate the result as
        <strong> f to the power of s </strong>. <br /> 2. If the current iteration is one more than
        a multiple of 3, calculate the result as </strong> f divided by s with using floor division </strong> (round the
        normal division result to the smaller number). <br />
        3. If the current iteration
        is two more than a multiple of 3, calculate the result as
        <strong> f x s </strong> Output the result in an individual line.<br />
        Set the first number to be the current second number and set the
        second number to be the calculated result. <br /> Continue with the next
        iteration.
        <br />
        <br />
        DO NOT write any prompt messages inside the input functions.
        Be careful with your output, such as spacing in the output or upper
        case messages.
