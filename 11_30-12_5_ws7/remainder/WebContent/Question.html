          In this question, you are asked to print numbers according to the
          following:
        </p>
  
        <p>
          You need to read a file with 3 integers.
          The file starts with an integer seed value. <br /> You need to read two
          additional positive integers from the file as the first number (f) and
          second number (s), respectively.<br /> Check if the second one is less than
          the first one or any of the numbers are negative. If so, display
          <strong>INVALID INPUT</strong> and call `exit()`.<br /><br /> Generate a single
          random integer between 5 and 10 as the repetition count. <br />Output the
          first number followed by the second number in individual lines. <br />Repeat
          the following as much as the repetition count:<br /> 1. If the current iteration
          is a multiple of 3, calculate the result as
          <strong> f multiplied by 4 and s added </strong>. <br /> 2. If the current iteration is one more than
          a multiple of 3, calculate the result as <strong> multiply f by 7, add s to it, then divide it by 1000. Remainder is the new number. </strong> <br />
          3. If the current iteration
          is two more than a multiple of 3, calculate the result as
          <strong> f multiplied by 3 and then added s </strong> . <br/> Output the result in an individual line.<br />
          Set the first number to be the current second number and set the
          second number to be the calculated result. <br /> Continue with the next
          iteration.
          <br />
          <br />
          DO NOT write any prompt messages inside the input functions.
          Be careful with your output, such as spacing in the output or upper
          case messages.
