          In this question, you are asked to print numbers according to the
          following:
        </p>

        <p>
          The program receives an integer seed value You need to receive two
          additional positive integers from the user as the first number (f) and
          second number (s), respectively. Check if the second one is less than
          the first one or any of the numbers are negative. If so, display
          <strong>INVALID INPUT</strong> and call exit(). Generate a single
          random integer between 5 and 20 as the repetition count. Output the
          first number followed by the second number in individual lines. Repeat
          the following as much as the repetition count: If the current iteration
          is a multiple of 3, calculate the result as
          <strong> 2 x f + s</strong> If the current iteration is one more than
          a multiple of 3, calculate the result as the remainder of
          <strong> 3 x f + s</strong> divided by 1000 If the current iteration
          is two more than a multiple of 3, calculate the result as
          <strong> 4 x f + s</strong> Output the result in an individual line.
          Set the first number to be the current second number and set the
          second number to be the calculated result. Continue with the next
          iteration.
          <br/>
          DO NOT write any prompt messages inside the input functions.
          Be careful with your output, such as spacing in the output or upper
          case messages.
