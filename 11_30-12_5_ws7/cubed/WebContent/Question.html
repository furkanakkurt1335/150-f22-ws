      <p>
        In this question, you are asked to print numbers according to the
        following:
      </p>

      <p>
        You need to read a file with 3 integers.
        The file starts with an integer seed value. <br>
        You need to read two additional positive integers from the file as the first number (f) and second number (s), respectively. <br>
        Check if the second one is less than the first one or any of the numbers are negative. If so, display
        <strong>INVALID INPUT</strong> and call `exit()`.<br><br> 
        
        Generate a single random integer between 15 and 50 as the repetition count. <br>
        Output the first number followed by the second number in individual lines. <br>
        
        Repeat the following as much as the repetition count:<br>
        1. If the current iteration is a multiple of 3, calculate the result as <strong> 2Â·f subtracted from s </strong>. <br>
        2. If the current iteration is one more than a multiple of 3, calculate the result as </strong> the sum of f and s </strong>. <br>
        3. If the current iteration is two more than a multiple of 3, calculate the result as <strong> s to the power of 3 </strong>. <br>
        
        Output the result in an individual line.<br>
        At the end, convert the result into an integer, for all 3 cases above.<br>
        Then, set the first number to be the current second number and set the second number to be the calculated result. <br> Continue with the next iteration. <br> <br>

        DO NOT write any prompt messages inside the input functions.
        Be careful with your output, such as spacing in the output or upper
        case messages.
      </p>
