                In this question, you are asked to read a file with random amount of numbers in separate lines. You need to read them into a list as integers. <br>
                You need to iterate over the list of integers and sum every 2 consecutive numbers. <br>
                For example, if the list is [1,2,3], your first sum is 1+2=3, and the second is 2+3=5. <br>
                You are requested to print integers for every 2 consecutive numbers as follows, in separate lines: <br>
                Sum 2 consecutive numbers. <br>
                If the sum is a multiple of 3, print the sum. <br>
                If the sum is one more than a multiple of 3, print the square of the sum. <br>
                If the sum is two more than a multiple of 3, print the least significant digit of the number. <br>
                </p>
