          In this question, you are given a file with a body of text. You need to split the text into words. Then, you are asked to count the occurrences of the first characters in the words. At the end, you need to print each character (that occurs at least once as the first character) and the amount of its occurrence as a first character in separate lines, characters in alphabetical order.
        </p>
