        <p>
          In this question, you are given a file with a body of text.
          You are expected to remove dots and commas from the text, and <b>upper</b> all letters in the text.
          Then, you need to count the occurrences of each word (text is split by <code>split(' ')</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>NOTE:</b>If the occurrence of a word is less than 2, you need to remove those words from your counting structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The procedure you need to follow with the <b>remaining</b> words is as follows:
          <ol>
            <li>Output the remaining words (<b>sorted</b> and then <b>first 2 members left out</b>) and their occurrence counts in
                  separate lines, as seen below.</li>
            <ul><li>if there are 2 or fewer words remained, only output the 2nd task below.</li></ul>
            <li>Output the resulting text as follows:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Rewrite the sentence without using words that appear less than 2 times and not using the first occurrence of words that appear more than once in the sentence. (For example, if the input is "There are two kinds of pain. The sort of pain that makes you strong, or useless pain. The sort of pain that's only suffering. I have no patience for useless things.", the last sentence should be "OF PAIN PAIN THE SORT OF PAIN USELESS" </li>
                <li>Without dots and commas,</li>
                <li>All letters are upper-cased</li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>For example</u>: in <code>file1.txt</code>, when you sort the words and ignore words with occurrence counts
            less than 3, the first 2 words are <code>a</code> and <code>array</code>. We report occurrence counts without
            these two words.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end when we print the entire text back, we only use the first two occurrences of each word. We
            skip the third, fourth, ... occurrences. Please carefully examine the examples below:
