        <p>
          In this question, you are given a file with a body of text.
          You are expected to remove dots and commas from the text, and <b>upper</b> all letters in the text.
          Then, you need to count the occurrences of each word (text is split by <code>split(' ')</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>NOTE:</b>If the occurrence of a word is less than 2, you need to remove those words from your counting structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The procedure you need to follow with the <b>remaining</b> words is as follows:
          <ol>
            <li>Output the remaining words (<b>sorted</b> and then <b>first 2 members left out</b>) and their occurrence counts in
                  separate lines, as seen below.</li>
            <ul><li>if there are 2 or fewer words remained, only output the 2nd task below.</li></ul>
            <li>Output the resulting text as follows:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Rewrite the sentence without using words that appear less than 2 times in the sentence.</li>
                <li>Without dots and commas,</li>
                <li>All letters are upper-cased</li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>For example</u>: in <code>file1.txt</code>, when you sort the words and ignore words with occurrence counts
            less than 3, the first 2 words are <code>a</code> and <code>array</code>. We report occurrence counts without
            these two words.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end when we print the entire text back, we only use the first two occurrences of each word. We
            skip the third, fourth, ... occurrences. Please carefully examine the examples below:

in computer science binary search also known as half-interval search logarithmic or binary chop is a algorithm that finds the position of a target value within sorted array compares the target value to middle element of array if they are not equal half in which cannot lie is eliminated and continues on remaining half again taking middle element to compare and repeating this until found if ends with remaining being empty not

in mathematics and computer science an algorithm is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform computation algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing more advanced algorithms can perform automated deductions (referred as automated reasoning) use mathematical logical tests divert the code execution through various routes (referred decision-making) using human characteristics descriptors machines in metaphorical ways was already practiced by alan turing with terms such "memory" "search" "stimulus"
