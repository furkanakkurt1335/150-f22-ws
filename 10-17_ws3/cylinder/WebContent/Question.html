<h1>
<span>Workshop Question 2: File IO</span>
</h1>

<p><span>Please read <a href='ReadMe.html'> important information</a> first. </span>

</p>

<h2 ><span>Description</span></h2>

<p> We will use a cylinder which has a radius <i> r </i> and a height <i> h </i>, for this question.

We will also use a cup and a glass.

<p><span>Read the four variables <i>r, h, cup_volume, glass_volume</i> from a given file name, each placed in a separate line, respectively. </span></p>

<hr>

<p>

Write three functions <i>calculate_cylinder_base_area</i>, <i> calculate_cylinder_lateral_area</i>, and <i>calculate_cylinder_volume</i>. 

</p>

<p>
  
<code>calculate_cylinder_base_area </code> must calculate the cylinder's base area (circle) as <i>3 * r<sup>2</sup></i> and return that value, taking the PI as 3.

</p>

<p>
<code>calculate_cylinder_lateral_area </code> must calculate <i> 2 * 3 * r * h </i> and return that value, taking the PI as 3.
</p>

<p>
<code>calculate_cylinder_volume</code> must evaluate the volume of the cylinder by <i> 3 * r <sup>2</sup> * h </i>.

</p>

<hr>

<p>

We have a cup which is larger than our cylinder and we wish to fill it by using cylinder. Display how many times we should use the cylinder (which has its base removed) to fill the cup fully. (The cup's volume is a multiple of the cylinder's volume.)

</p>

<p>

Next, we have a glass which is smaller than our cylinder and we wish to fill the cylinder (which has its base removed) by using the glass's entire volume; however this time, the cylinder's volume is not a multiple of the glass so the cylinder will not be full in the end. Display as integer what percentage of the cylinder's volume will be empty.
