# Question tester for pre-grading check during exam.
# The tests feed the necessary input to your executable similar to the grading process.

# Value of the "executable_file" variable must match to the specified executable in TCAdmin
# Students or candidates should not modify this file, otherwise, compilation problems may occur during grading.

# Instructors can add as many tests as they need.
# In each testX() function, the test number, input lines and expected output lines must be returned.
# Be careful with the use of """ at the end of input and expected output:
# Terminating """ of the expected output has to be placed on a separate line,
# whereas the terminating """ of the input has to be placed on the same line as the last input line.

# Some students return the expected value without any calculation, so it is a better practice
# to avoid using these test values among the actual grading test cases.  Modified versions of this file
# can be bundled with the question for the students to use during exam and project development.
