</h1>

<p><span>Please read <a href='ReadMe.html'> important information</a> first. </span>

<h2 ><span>Description</span></h2>

<p> We will use the number of hours in a Shinsoo day <i> hours_in_shinsoo_day </i>, the number of Shinsoo days in a Shinsoo year <i> days_in_shinsoo_year </i>, seconds spent by someone on that planet <i> counter </i> for this question.

<p><span>Read the three variables <i>hours_in_shinsoo_day, days_in_shinsoo_year, counter </i> from a given file name, each placed in a separate line, respectively. </span></p>

Have you ever been on planet Shinsoo? A day on Shinsoo takes X hours, and a year takes Y Shinsoo days. Suppose you hop on Elon Musk's rocket and go to the planet Shinsoo. Assume that you are asking someone living on Shinsoo how long they have been on there. They are showing their counter. This counter shows how many seconds they have been on that planet. Can you take the counter as inputs, calculate how many Shinsoo years, how many Shinsoo days, how many hours, minutes and seconds someone has been on Shinsoo, respectively, and print them on separate lines? If he has been on Shinsoo for more than 1 Shinsoo century (100 Shinsoo years), print "longer than a century" on a separate line.
