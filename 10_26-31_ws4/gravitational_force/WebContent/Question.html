<h2 ><span>Description</span></h2>

<p> We will use mass of the first object <i> first_mass </i>, mass of the second object <i> second_mass </i>, distance between the objects <i> distance </i> for this question.

<p><span>Read the three variables <i>first_mass, second_mass, distance </i> from a given file name, each placed in a separate line, respectively. </span></p>

Ever wondered how planets revolve around the Sun? The Earth attracts the Moon, and the Moon attracts the Earth, so shouldn’t they both just collide? Why doesn’t the Moon fall? Why does it keep revolving around the Earth? All these questions can be answered by understanding the concepts of gravitation. The universal force of attraction, which is acting between objects,  is known as the gravitational force. It is one of the fundamental forces of the universe. Gravitational force can be formulated as follows: 
F = G(m1*m2)/(r^2)
You are expected to calculate and print the magnitude of gravitational force using the formula and the inputs.
If the magnitude of gravitational force is more than or equal to the sum of all inputs, print "more than or equal to the sum" in a separate line.
