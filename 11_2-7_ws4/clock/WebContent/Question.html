        <p>
          You will be given 2 files as input in order in the forms of
          <i>'time*.txt'</i> and <i>'offset*.txt'</i> (* represents a number).
          You are supposed to read the first file (<i>'time*.txt'</i>) entirely.
          This file's content will represent time of a day as a string (e.g.
          '1050' meaning 10:50 AM, using a 24-hour system), you may convert it
          to an integer and perform operations to store the time's hour and
          minute values in 2 different variables. You are then supposed to read
          from the second file (<i>'offset*.txt'</i>). The content of the second
          file represents seconds and you may store it in a variable as an
          integer. You are requested to calculate what the time would be (given
          in the first file) after adding the seconds (given in the second file)
          to it. You are requested to print a string, according to the following
          instructions:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. If the resultant time is before noon (12:00), print "Before noon".
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If the resultant time is after noon (12:00), print "After noon".
        </p>
        <p>3. If the resultant time is just noon (12:00), print "High noon".</p>
        <p>In the end, only 1 line will be printed.</p>
