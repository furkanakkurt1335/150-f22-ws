</h1>

<p><span>Please read <a href='ReadMe.html'> important information</a> first. </span>

<h2 ><span>Description</span></h2>

<p> We will use the number of hours in a Shinsoo day <i> hours_in_shinsoo_day </i>, the number of Shinsoo days in a Shinsoo year <i> days_in_shinsoo_year </i>, seconds spent by someone on that planet <i> counter </i> for this question.

<p><span>Read the three variables <i>hours_in_shinsoo_day, days_in_shinsoo_year, counter </i> from a given file name, each placed in a separate line, respectively. </span></p>

Have you ever been on planet Shinsoo? A day on Shinsoo takes X hours, and a year takes Y Shinsoo days. Suppose you hop on Elon Musk's rocket and go to the planet Shinsoo. Assume that you are asking other people living on Shinsoo how long they have been on there. They are showing their counters. This counter shows how many seconds they have been on that planet. Can you take the counters of these people as inputs, calculate how many Shinsoo years, how many Shinsoo days, how many hours and seconds they have been on Shinsoo, respectively, and print them on separate lines? If he has been on Shinsoo for more than or equal to 1 Shinsoo millenium (1000 Shinsoo years), print "longer than a millenium" on the separate line. Else if he has been on Shinsoo for more than or equal to 1 Shinsoo century (100 Shinsoo years), print "longer than a century" on the separate line. Else, print "less than a century" on the separate line.
