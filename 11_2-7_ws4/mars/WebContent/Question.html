        <p>
          You will be given 2 files as input in order in the forms of
          <i>'file*.txt'</i> and <i>'integer*.txt'</i> (* represents a number).
          You are supposed to read the first file (<i>'file*.txt'</i>) entirely,
          convert the content of the file to an integer and store it as a
          variable. This integer represents how many characters you are supposed
          to read from the second file (<i>'integer*.txt'</i>). You are supposed
          to convert the content of the second file (read only as much as the
          stored variable amount) to an integer if it's not given as such
          (possibly an alphabetic character). This integer represents seconds.
          You are requested to print a string, according to the following
          instructions:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. If the integer in seconds represents less than or equal to 1 day,
          print "Less than 1 day".
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If the integer in seconds represents more than 1 day, print "More
          than 1 day".
        </p>
        <p>
          3. If the integer in seconds represents more than 1 year, print "More
          than 1 year". Do not print "More than 1 day".
        </p>
        <p>
          Years and days are of Mars, 687 days and 25 hours, respectively. In
          the end, only 1 line will be printed.
        </p>
